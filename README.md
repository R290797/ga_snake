# 🐍 Snake AI - Version 11.5

## Overview
This project is a **genetic algorithm-based Snake AI** that allows:
- **Manual Play** 🕹️ (Control the snake yourself)
- **AI Training Mode** 🤖 (Train an AI to optimize survival & food collection)
- **Pre-Trained AI Mode** 🧠 (Use pre-trained models with optimized strategies)
- **Persistent Leaderboard** 🏆 (Tracks and saves AI training results)

The game leverages **`pygame`** for rendering, **`numpy`** for AI calculations, and **a genetic algorithm** for evolving AI behavior.

---

## **Introduction**
Welcome to **AI Snake**, where you can either **train an AI** to play Snake or take control yourself!  
Using **evolutionary principles**, the AI learns **optimal movement strategies**, balancing **exploration and efficiency**.  
This project was developed to demonstrate **machine learning in a game-based environment**.

## **📌 Game Modes**
### 1️⃣ Manual Play
- **Control the snake** using the **arrow keys**.
- **Eat food** to grow **without hitting walls or yourself**.
- **Goal:** Survive as long as possible!

### 2️⃣ AI Training Mode
- **Trains an AI** using a **genetic algorithm** 🧬.
- Users **set the number of snakes & generations** before training.
- **Goal:** AI learns to optimize food collection and survival.

### 3️⃣ Pre-Trained AI Mode
- Select from **pre-trained AI models** with **different strategies**:
  - **Hunter:** Aggressively moves towards food.
  - **Strategist:** Balances food-seeking & survival.
  - **Explorer:** Explores more before committing.
  - **Risk-Taker:** Moves quickly but takes high risks.
- **Watch how different strategies perform!**
